=head1 NAME

RT::Extension::MergeUsers - Merges two users into the same effective user

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This RT extension adds a "Merge Users" box to the User Administration page,
which allows you to merge the user you are currently viewing with another
user on your RT instance.

It also adds L</MergeInto> and L</UnMerge> functions to the L<RT::User> class,
which allow you to programmatically accomplish the same thing from your code.

It also provides a version of L<CanonicalizeEmailAddress>, which means that
all e-mail sent from secondary users is displayed as coming from the primary
user.

=head1 INSTALLATION

Be sure to also read L</UPGRADING> if you are upgrading.

=over

=item C<perl Makefile.PL>

=item C<make>

=item C<make install>

May need root permissions

=item Edit your F</opt/rt4/etc/RT_SiteConfig.pm>

If you are using RT 4.2 or greater, add this line:

    Plugin('RT::Extension::MergeUsers');

For RT 4.0, add this line:

    Set(@Plugins, qw(RT::Extension::MergeUsers));

or add C<RT::Extension::MergeUsers> to your existing C<@Plugins> line.

=item Clear your mason cache

    rm -rf /opt/rt4/var/mason_data/obj

=item Restart your webserver

=back

=head1 UPGRADING

If you are upgrading from 0.03_01 or earlier, you must run
F<bin/rt-update-merged-users>.  This script will create MergedUsers
Attributes so RT can know when you're looking at a user that other users
have been merged into. If you don't run this script, you'll have issues
unmerging users. It can be safely run multiple times, it will only
create Attributes as needed.

=head1 UTILITIES

=head2 rt-clean-merged-users

When a user with another user merged into it is shredded,
the attributes on that user are also shredded, but the
merged user will remain, along with attributes that may point
to the now missing user id. This script cleans up attributes
if the merged-into user record is now gone. These users will then be
converted back to regular unmerged users.

=head2 rt-merge-users

A command-line tool to merge one user into another

=head1 CAVEATS

=head2 RT::Shredder and Merged Users

Merging a user effectively makes it impossible to load the merged user
directly. Attempting to access the old user resolves to the merged-into user.
Because of this, MergeUsers has some extra code to help L<RT::Shredder>
clean up these merged records to avoid leaving merged user records in the DB
while removing the user they were merged into.

When running L<RT::Shredder> on a user record with other users merged into it,
the merged users are Unmerged before the initial user record is shredded.
There are two options to handle these newly unmerged users:

=over

=item 1.

Re-run your shredder command with the same or similar options. The unmerged
user records will now be accessible and, depending on your shredder options,
they will likely be shredded on the second run. If you have multiple
layers of merged users, you may need to run shredder multiple times.

=item 2.

MergeUsers will log the unmerged users at the C<info> level so you can pull
the user ids from the log and shred them manually. This is most likely to
be useful if you are shredding one specific user (and all merged accounts).
